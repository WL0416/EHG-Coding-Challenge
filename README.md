## EHG Programming Challenge

This program will produce an image in which each colour occurs exactly once -- with no repetition and no used colours.

Colours are formed by combining a red, green, and blue component in the range 0..255

The program will break each component into 32 steps -- 8, 16, 24 , .. 256 -- which means there will have 32,768 discrete colours.

## Usage

1. git clone https://github.com/WL0416/EHG-Coding-Challenge.git
2. cd [project folder]
3. npm install
4. npm start

Simply change the width or height dimension to generate the image filled with discrete colours.
