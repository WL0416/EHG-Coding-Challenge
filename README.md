## EHG Programming Challenge

This program will produce an image in which each colour occurs exactly once -- with no repetition and no used colours.

Colours are formed by combining a red, green, and blue component in the range 0..256

The program will break each component into 32 steps -- 8, 16, 24 , .. 256 -- which means there will have 32,768 discrete colours.

## Usage

Simply change the width or height dimension to generate the image filled with discrete colours.
